=head1 NAME

Mojo::Collection::Role::UtilsBy - List::UtilsBy methods for Mojo::Collection

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Mojo::Collection 'c';
  my $c = c(1..12)->with_roles('+UtilsBy');
  say 'Reverse lexical order: ', $c->rev_sort_by(sub { $_ })->join(',');
  
  use List::Util 'product';
  say "Product of 3 elements: $_" for $c->bundle_by(sub { product(@_) }, 3)->each;
  
  my %partitions = $c->partition_by(sub { $_ % 4 });
  # 0 => c(4,8,12), 1 => c(1,5,9), 2 => c(2,6,10), 3 => c(3,7,11)
  
  my $evens = $c->extract_by(sub { $_ % 2 == 0 }); # $c now contains only odd numbers

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A role to augment L<Mojo::Collection> with methods that call functions from
L<List::UtilsBy>.

=head1 METHODS

L<Mojo::Collection::Role::UtilsBy> composes the following methods.

=head2 bundle_by

  my $bundled_collection = $c->bundle_by(sub { [@_] }, $n);

Return a new collection containing the results from the passed function, given
input elements in bundles of (up to) C<$n>, using L<List::UtilsBy/"bundle_by">.

=head2 count_by

  my %counts = $c->count_by(sub { $_->name });

Return a list of key-value pairs where the values are the number of times each
key was returned from the passed function, using L<List::UtilsBy/"count_by">.

=head2 extract_by

  my $extracted_collection = $c->extract_by(sub { $_->num > 5 });

Remove elements from the collection that return true from the passed function
using L<List::UtilsBy/"extract_by">, and return a new collection containing the
removed elements.

=head2 extract_first_by

  my $extracted_element = $c->extract_first_by(sub { $_->name eq 'Fred' });

Remove and return the first element from the collection that returns true from
the passed function using L<List::UtilsBy/"extract_first_by">.

=head2 max_by

  my $max_element = $c->max_by(sub { $_->num });

Return the element from the collection that returns the numerically largest
result from the passed function with L<List::UtilsBy/"max_by">.

=head2 min_by

  my $min_element = $c->min_by(sub { $_->num });

Return the element from the collection that returns the numerically smallest
result from the passed function with L<List::UtilsBy/"min_by">.

=head2 nsort_by

  my $sorted_collection = $c->nsort_by(sub { $_->num });

Return a new collection containing the elements sorted numerically by the
results from the passed function, using L<List::UtilsBy/"nsort_by">.

=head2 partition_by

  my %collections = $c->partition_by(sub { $_->name });

Return a list of key-value pairs where the values are collections of the
elements that returned that key from the passed function, using
L<List::UtilsBy/"partition_by">.

=head2 rev_nsort_by

  my $sorted_collection = $c->rev_nsort_by(sub { $_->num });

Return a new collection containing the elements sorted numerically in reverse
by the results from the passed function, using L<List::UtilsBy/"rev_nsort_by">.

=head2 rev_sort_by

  my $sorted_collection = $c->rev_sort_by(sub { $_->name });

Return a new collection containing the elements sorted lexically in reverse
by the results from the passed function, using L<List::UtilsBy/"rev_sort_by">.

=head2 sort_by

  my $sorted_collection = $c->sort_by(sub { $_->name });

Return a new collection containing the elements sorted lexically by the results
from the passed function, using L<List::UtilsBy/"sort_by">.

=head2 uniq_by

  my $uniq_collection = $c->uniq_by(sub { $_->name });

Return a new collection containing the elements that return stringwise unique
values from the passed function, using L<List::UtilsBy/"uniq_by">.

=head2 weighted_shuffle_by

  my $shuffled_collection = $c->weighted_shuffle_by(sub { $_->num });

Return a new collection containing the elements shuffled with weighting
according to the results from the passed function, using
L<List::UtilsBy/"weighted_shuffle_by">.
